# NotReced

Ever wanted to play a Deck where every card you cast makes your opponent read it twice?
NotReced checks if a specific MTG card is *not* reccomended by [EDHRec](https://edhrec.com) to make it easier building an underdog deck, not playerd by anyone.

Given a card, NotReced checks the card's color idendity with the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) and looks for that card on the appropriate page of EDHRecs most played card of that color.
